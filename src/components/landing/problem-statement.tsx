            <p>
              Traditional weather monitoring systems are often expensive, geographically limited, and inaccessible to the general public. This data gap makes it difficult for individuals, small-scale farmers, and local researchers to make informed decisions based on real-time environmental conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Continuous and localized environmental monitoring is crucial for optimizing agriculture, advancing climate research, and improving public safety. Our project addresses this challenge by providing an affordable, open-source, and easily deployable weather station system.
