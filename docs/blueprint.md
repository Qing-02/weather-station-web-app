- Accent color: A vibrant, clear sky blue (#05B2FF), used for interactive elements and highlights to ensure contrast.
- Headline and body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for its modern, clean appearance and excellent readability across all data displays.
- Use a cohesive set of line-art or filled icons for navigation, data visualization elements (charts, filters, downloads), and weather conditions (sun, clouds, wind, rain).
- Implement a responsive, grid-based layout for the dashboard cards and historical data display, ensuring optimal viewing on various screen sizes, as well as clear segmentation for different data sections.
- Subtle and smooth transitions for data updates on cards and between navigation states. Implement interactive animations and tooltips for chart elements on hover.
